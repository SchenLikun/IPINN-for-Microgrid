# Introduction
This project aims for solving the ODEs in mircrogird, especially for forward (simulation) and inverse (parameters estimation) calculation of synchronous- and inverter-based DERs.

# Env. Info.
Python Version 3.11 backends PyTorch 2.0.1 + CU117 on NVIDIA A30 × 4

# Basic principles plz refer to our papers

# HOW TO USE
The example codes for both sync- and inverter-based DERs are [SYNC_MAIN.py](./PINN-for-Synchronous/SYNC_MAIN.py) and [PID_MAIN.py](./PINN-for-inverter-control-loop/PID_MAIN.py).

Before running, plz remember to install Torch and CUDA correctly.

If any path errors occur, please check **both the absolute and relative paths** of your running environment, if the error message is related to the path for storing the model, please **create a folder named `save_model/` on your own and add the path** accordingly.

The example data files [inverter-based DER data (Name: '0122FltQControl.csv')](./data/inverter-control-loop/0122FltQControl.csv) and [sync-based unit data (Name'927testforTe2.csv')](./data/synchronous-machine/927testforTe2.csv) are both generated by real-time digital simulation (RTDS) system.

## About PINN
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have unique advantages in solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) related to electrical power systems.

The main benefit is the ability to solve both forward and inverse problems with limited data and under conditions where the physical equations are not well-defined.

This capability is precisely why we have applied this method. For a detailed understanding of the principles behind PINNs, refer to the [DEEPXDE](https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


## About RTDS microgrid model
The established model is saved in `./RTDS-MODEL/SimpleMicrogrid`，the directory contains the following files.
1. `Microgrid1.dfx` : our established model, contains really perfect control and satisfying amount of detailed controls and measurement points XD. (I'm really super satisfied with the microgrid model I've built, even though my supervisor thinks it's quite ordinary. Still, I believe I've done a great job.)
2. `Microgrid1.sib` : runtime file, using this for RTDS simulation while running.
3. `Microgrid1.pdf` : official microgrid introduction document, differs from our model, but still has some reference value.
