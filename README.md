# Introduction
This project aims for solving the ODEs in mircrogird, especially for forward (simulation) and inverse (parameters estimation) calculation of synchronous- and inverter-based DERs.

# Env. Info.
Python Version 3.11 backends PyTorch 2.0.1 + CU117 on NVIDIA A30 Ã— 4

# Basic principles plz refer to our papers

# how to use
The example codes for both sync- and inverter-based DERs are './PINN-for-Synchronous/SYNC_MAIN.py'[../PINN-for-Synchronous/SYNC_MAIN.py](url) and './PINN-for-inverter-control-loop/PID_MAIN.py'.

Before running, plz remember to install Torch and CUDA correctly.
